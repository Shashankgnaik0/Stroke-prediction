# Stroke prediction
 Created a holistic system encompassing hardware and software domains for real-time health monitoring. Various sensors, including ECG, temperature, heart rate, and oximeters, captured vital body parameters.Diverse testing scenarios, including data from both healthy individuals and those at stroke risk, were employed.

 Data from sensors was efficiently transmitted to an Arduino, which, via Wi-Fi, uploaded it to the cloud using ThingSpeak for secure storage. Raw data from the cloud was then processed and fed into machine learning algorithms.results generated by these algorithms empowered medical professionals to offer timely assistance and guidance to patients, ensuring enhanced healthcare delivery.
